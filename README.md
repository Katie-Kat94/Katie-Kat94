My name is Katie Hulme.

After many years working within the film and television I decided it was a time for a career change. So I began looking for a career I could engage with creativly and spned my time solving puzzles - I of course landed on coding! 

After enrolling in and completing the Web Development Bootcamp I completed many projects, including 4Doption and Air B n Boats. I am now looking for roles that combine coding with my passion for film.
